    "description": "In the wee hours of the morning on August 18, 1961, the residents of Capitola, California were awakened by a surreal phenomenon:  Thousands of crazed sooty shearwaters were flying erratically through the streets, disgorging bits of fish, and crash landing, kamikaze-like into street lamps and roof tops.  A few brave souls ventured outside to investigate, but immediately retreated.  The birds, upon seeing the light from their flashlights, flew directly toward them.",
