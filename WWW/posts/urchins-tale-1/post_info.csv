,500 character max (inc spaces). Shorter is usually better. Aim for 200 characters.,Post Description,"If I were to ask you to name your favorite animal, chances are that it would not be a sea urchin. And I wouldn’t blame you - sea urchins are certainly not very charismatic, as far as animals go. At first glance, they come across as no more than a bunch of rock-like things with too many spikes and not enough personality. But there is much more to these weird, spiny critters than meets the eye.
