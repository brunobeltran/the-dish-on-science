    "description": "The Bay Area is a great place for hiking, and just last weekend I visited a nearby state park. On the trail, I saw two lizards with long tails sunning themselves on a rock and a millipede moving quickly toward the shade. A lizard\u2019s leg is made up of muscles, bones, and nerves, just like a human hiker\u2019s leg, but the details and shapes are very different. Why does a millipede have hundreds of legs, but most insects have only six? The answer? A special set of genes \u2013 the Hox genes.",
