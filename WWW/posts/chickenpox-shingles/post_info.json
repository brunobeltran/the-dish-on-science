    "description": "One in three people develop shingles in their lifetime. What causes this epidemic? The same virus that causes chickenpox causes shingles, Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)1.  VZV is a member of the herpes family - whose other members are responsible for cold sores and genital herpes1.  The first infection with VZV causes chickenpox2.  Once the active infection is over, the virus becomes latent - it\u2019s still present in your body, but it\u2019s now hiding from your immune system in nerve cells i.e. neurons3.  If the virus re-activates, this secondary infection is called shingles3.",
