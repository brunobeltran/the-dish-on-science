   legacy articles such that we truncate their descriptions to the correct

#. in post-instruction.tex add style guide for references, in-line lists, using
   e.g. <h3> tags (###) for section titles,    where to put captions, etc.
#. move facebook like and twitter buttons to the post itself, and make them point
   to each specific article instead of to the webpage as a whole

   * global dish on science like button should take you to dish on science
     facebook page
   * make facebook page
   * for each article, have a like button with reasonably preompleted
     text/image
   * twitter button should go to twitter page?
   * article should be shareable via twitter
   * add a "share on reddit" button

#. Science Dictionary

   * on desktop, we want definition to pop up in "right of article" div
